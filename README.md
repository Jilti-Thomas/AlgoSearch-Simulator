# üîç AlgoSearch Simulator

AlgoSearch Simulator is a Java-based project that integrates **Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, Computer Organization, and Probability & Statistics** concepts into one practical simulation.  
The project demonstrates how different algorithms perform on simulated CPU architectures (Basic, Mid, Pro) and visualizes their efficiency using ASCII bar charts.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project shows how **sorting and searching algorithms** behave when executed under different hardware-like conditions.  
By simulating multiple CPUs, it highlights how execution speed impacts algorithm performance.  
Statistical analysis (average runtime and standard deviation) provides deeper insights into efficiency and reliability.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This project integrates multiple computer science concepts into one simulation.  
It helped me understand:
- How algorithms behave under different conditions  
- How OOP makes projects modular and extensible  
- How CPU architecture affects execution time  
- How statistical analysis gives insights into performance patterns  

This mirrors **real-world software system design**, where efficiency matters across hardware, software, and data.
